The idea behind Authorizer is to use smartphones as a hardware password manager.
To avoid manual typing of long and complex passwords everytime you need them,
Authorizer pretends to be an USB keyboard (e.g. over an USB On-The-Go adapter).
With a button press inside the App, it will automatically enters the password for you
on your PC, laptop, tablet or main smartphone, even in special situations (e.g. inside BIOS).


For USB keyboard emulation, Authorizer requires a special Android kernel/rom.

Authorizer is based on/a fork of PasswdSafe.
